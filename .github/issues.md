# General

**Read the readme!!**  
Most issues can be solved just by reading the full readme file.  
Also make sure you have followed all the installation steps correctly.

**Search for similar issues**  
Double posts will be closed, so make sure your issue doesn't exist yet (also look for closed ones).

**Don't aswer via email**  
Just don't answer issues with your email, please...

**Don't paste links to shops**  
It's odd that I have to say this, but don't just send your ebay or amazon links to show what hardware you're using.
It's enough to say what model or version it is.

**Apply some common sense**  
Also odd to mention this, but think about what you want to ask or answer and then post it.  
***Use a clear, short headline with a good understandable description of your issue.***  
Don't spam with issues, post or pictures! Be nice, understanding and help others. 
Also note that this is an open source project. No one must help you, so be thankfull for every help you get.

# Bugs

**Read the FAQ**  
Read the FAQ, which is a part of the readme.

**Make sure it's related to this project**  
Make sure your issue is related to this project and doesn't occur when uploading other code to the device.

**Post as much information as possible**  
What installation method, OS, browser and ESP8266 version are you useing?
If your dealing with a bug in the webinterface, check if the browsers developer tools show you an error.  
If you have a very long error log use [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/).  

**Try out the testing branch**  
Can be found here: https://github.com/spacehuhn/esp8266_deauther/tree/testing
You'll need to compile it with Arduino.

# Feature Requests

Just a few notes here:
- Add an detailed description.
- Research if it can be implemented (if it's possible using the hardware, software etc.)
- Research if such a feature exists in an other project
- Be sure it's really usefull for everyone (you'll need some common sense here!)
- Try to implement it yourself!
